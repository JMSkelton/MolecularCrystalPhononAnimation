MolecularCrystalPhononAnimation
===============================

A set of Python scripts for generating animations of phonon modes in molecular crystals.

The main advantage over various other animation programs (e.g. `V_Sim`) is that molecules can be expanded outside of the unit-cell boundary, which makes it much easier to classify molecular modes.

Animations are initially generated as XYZ-format files to be rendered in an external program before being combined into animated GIFs.
Using siftware such as `VMD` for rendering gives a high level of control over the "look" of the animations.

Examples to be added shortly!
